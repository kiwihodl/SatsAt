# App Store Compliance Guide for Bitcoin Apps

## üè™ Navigating App Store Guidelines for Satsat

Based on research into recent App Store rejections and approvals for Bitcoin/crypto apps, here's a comprehensive compliance strategy.

## Critical App Store Guidelines

### Guideline 3.1.1 - In-App Purchases
**"Apps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or functionality, such as license keys, augmented reality markers, QR codes, cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency wallets, etc."**

### Guideline 3.1.5 - Cryptocurrencies
**"Apps may facilitate transactions or transmissions of cryptocurrency on an approved exchange, provided they are offered only in countries or regions where the app has appropriate licensing and permissions to provide a cryptocurrency exchange."**

## üö® Common Rejection Patterns

### Apps That Have Been Rejected:
- **Coinbase Wallet**: Blocked for requiring gas fees via IAP for NFT transfers
- **1inch**: Rejected for direct marketplace links and "Buy" language
- **OpenSea iOS**: Removed ability to purchase NFTs directly
- **Magic Eden**: Required to clearly state NFTs are in "third-party services"

### Successful Strategies:
- **Educational positioning** over transactional
- **External web linking** instead of in-app purchases
- **Clear disclaimers** about third-party services
- **Viewing-only** features for assets

## ‚úÖ Compliance Strategy for Satsat

### 1. App Positioning
Position as an **educational savings app** rather than a financial product:

```
PRIMARY MESSAGING:
"Learn Bitcoin savings with friends through collaborative goals"

AVOID:
- "Buy Bitcoin"
- "Trade cryptocurrency" 
- "Exchange" or "wallet" in primary description

USE INSTEAD:
- "Educational Bitcoin experience"
- "Collaborative savings goals"
- "Learn about multisig security"
- "Practice Bitcoin concepts"
```

### 2. Feature Implementation

#### ‚úÖ Allowed Features:
- **Receive-only addresses** (viewing deposits)
- **Goal tracking** (progress monitoring)
- **Educational content** (how multisig works)
- **Group messaging** (encrypted chat)
- **Transaction viewing** (read-only)
- **PSBT sharing** (file export/import)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Restricted Features:
- **No in-app Bitcoin purchasing**
- **No direct exchange integration**
- **No gas fee payments via IAP**
- **No "Buy" buttons or language**

#### üîÑ Workaround Implementations:

```swift
// ‚úÖ COMPLIANT: External web linking
func openExternalExchange() {
    let url = URL(string: "https://strike.me")!
    UIApplication.shared.open(url)
}

// ‚ùå NON-COMPLIANT: In-app purchase
func buyBitcoinInApp() {
    // This would violate 3.1.1
    SKPaymentQueue.default().add(payment)
}

// ‚úÖ COMPLIANT: Educational explanation
Text("To add Bitcoin to your group savings, use external apps like Strike or Cash App, then send to the address below.")

// ‚ùå NON-COMPLIANT: Direct purchasing
Button("Buy Bitcoin") { /* opens in-app purchase */ }
```
