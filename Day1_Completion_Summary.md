## 🔐 **Security Features Implemented**

### **Two-Tier Encryption System**
```
✅ Personal Data (User's Eyes Only)
   - Private messages encrypted with user master key
   - Nostr private keys protected with biometrics
   - Personal notes and preferences secured

✅ Group Data (All Members Can Access)
   - Extended public keys (xpubs) encrypted with group key
   - Balance information shared among group members
   - Savings goals and progress tracking
   - Financial data collaboration enabled

✅ Database Protection
   - All sensitive data stored as encrypted blobs
   - Database admin cannot read any sensitive information
   - Context-specific key derivation prevents cross-contamination
```
